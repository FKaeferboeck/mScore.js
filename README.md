# mScore.js
A JavaScript library for musical typesetting and more

* Scores can be loaded from MScore.jsâ€™s own XML format, which is designed to be human-readable, intuitive and very concise for fast typing. Scores can also be created on the fly through JavaScript commands for use in interactive situations.
* MScore.js supports a growing number of features of traditional musical typesetting, including multiple stave systems, unlimited numbers of voices, clefs, keys, line justification, fine-tuning of positions and note stems. For more convenient input the user can pre-define rhythm patterns with which to lay out the entered notes.
* Notes and other items can be arbitrarily colored. MScore.js uses pre-rendered sprites for high-performance screen drawing.
* MScore.js provides an audio module for playback of musical scores. Sounds are generated in real-time. The synthesizer is a modified version of the Musical Keyboard module courtesy of Keith William Horwood (much obliged!)
* An interaction module provides capability to select/modify content with mouse/keyboard (only elementary hovering/selecting/dragging implemented as of now).
